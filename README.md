### Motivation :mechanical_arm:

<div style="text-align:justify">

Motivation is what drives us to succeed in life, and when it comes to computer science, algorithms & data structures
provide the necessary tools to achieve that success. The classic game of Battleship relies heavily on these concepts as
players must efficiently search through a grid of potential targets while maximizing their chances of hitting the
opponent's ships. Optimization is key in this game, as slow searching can mean the difference between victory and
defeat. This is where algorithms come into play - by implementing sophisticated searching techniques such as binary
search or A* search, players can quickly traverse the board and locate enemy ships with minimal effort. Likewise, data
structures like hash tables assist in storing player moves for easy retrieval later on. In combining these methods with
strategic planning and intuition, players can become masters of modern-day Battleship strategy.

## Acknowledgments<a name="Acknowledgments">:brain:

<div style="text-align:justify">

We would want to express our gratitude to Dr. Tran Thanh Tung for providing us with the chance to participate in this
project and apply what we learned in theory into practice. This project's learning curve was steep, but it was well
worth it for all of us. We have learned more about interface technologies to construct a functioning application that
interacts with our project. Sir, we want to thank you again for all the hard work and expertise that you have put into
your teaching. We'll make sure that all we've learned doesn't go to waste, and that we can master them better from now
on :heart:
